## Shout out and thank you to Ben

Thank you Benland100 for liscensing srbot under the GPLv3, so we could use
some of the srbot's color algorithims.

Please check out https://github.com/BenLand100 and look at his great projects.
Including the (in)famous S.M.A.R.T. project that was the backbone of an entire
generation of color botting.
